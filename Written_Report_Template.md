# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This analysis of the Kickstarter data visualizes the success & fail rates of theater and play campaigns. It observes the success & fail rates over time and how success & fail rates of campaigns evolve across various goal ranges.

### Purpose

This analysis will help Louise compare the performance of her play, Fever, to the performance of other plays and theater productions. This analysis will provide insight into her interest of how success and fail rates change over time and goal range. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Below is a visualization showing the monthly number of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns from 2009 to 2017. You'll notice:
 * Theater campaigns typically experience the most success during May. In fact, April-July is a stretch of months where campaigns see higher success rates.
 * During the fall and winter, especially beginning at October, theater campaigns experience less success. Surprisingly, February is an abnormal winter month where theater productions have historically reaped more success. Additional research should be conducted to understand why February experiences this success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Below is a visualization that shows success/fail rates of play campaigns across various ranges of goals established.

 * Campaigns that set goals of less than $15K tend to experience more success than campaigns that set goals above $15K. The success rate is higher than the fail rate for campaigns that set goals between $35K-45K; however, the number of campaigns in this goal range is very small. There are hundreds of play campaigns that set goals of less than $15K and a majority succeed in attaining their goal, which leads to the confident conclusion/recommendation that it is best to set goals below $15K.



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
